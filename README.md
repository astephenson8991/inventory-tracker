About This Project: Inventory Tracking Program
This inventory tracking program is a C# Windows Forms application I developed as a key project for my bachelor's degree. This project allowed me to gain practical experience and demonstrate proficiency in several core software development areas.

Through the development of this application, I learned and applied:


Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles: I implemented concepts such as inheritance with the Part (abstract), InPart, and OutPart classes, demonstrating polymorphism and code reusability. I also utilized encapsulation to manage data within the Part and Product classes.

Windows Forms Development: I gained hands-on experience in creating user interfaces with C# Windows Forms, including the design and implementation of various forms for managing parts and products. This involved working with controls like DataGridView to display data, TextBox for input, and RadioButton for selecting options.

Event Handling: I learned to handle user interactions by implementing event handlers for button clicks, text changes, and other UI events to trigger program logic.

Data Structures and Binding: The use of BindingList was fundamental to dynamically connect data collections (Parts and Products) to the DataGridView controls on the forms, ensuring the UI automatically reflected changes in the data.

Data Validation and Error Handling: I incorporated input validation to ensure data integrity, checking for required fields, correct data types (like decimals for price), and logical constraints (e.g., minimum stock not exceeding maximum). I also used try-catch blocks for basic error handling to provide a more robust user experience.

Managing Object Relationships: I implemented the functionality to associate Part objects with Product objects, demonstrating the ability to model and manage relationships between different entities within an application.

Application Structure: I developed an understanding of basic application structure, including the main entry point (Program.cs) and navigating between different forms (MainScreenForm, AddPartForm, ModifyPartForm, AddProductForm, ModifyProductForm).
